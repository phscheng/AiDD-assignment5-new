## AI Reflection
Creating my personal website in Cursor with AI assistance was both efficient and collaborative. AI saved me a great deal of time by generating the initial layout, formatting the pages, and suggesting consistent color themes, font pairings, and spacing that gave the website a cohesive look. I relied heavily on AI for maintaining visual and structural consistency across multiple sections, which helped the site feel polished and professional. However, I still had to step in and manually edit certain sections where AI’s output didn’t fully capture the functionalities specified in the assignment instructions. Sometimes, AI-generated code included redundant elements or styles that conflicted with others, requiring me to refine and simplify them myself. This balance between automation and hands-on editing taught me how to integrate AI tools effectively into my workflow—using them for structure, formatting, and inspiration while maintaining control over the creative direction and technical precision of my final website.
